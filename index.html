                <h2>Viewport and Media Queries in Web Development</h2>
                <p>Viewport and media queries are both crucial concepts in web development, particularly in making websites responsive to different devices and screen sizes. Here's a breakdown of each:</p>

                <!-- Content about viewports and media queries -->
                <!-- Replace this comment with the provided text -->

                <!-- Provided text about viewports and media queries -->
                <h2>Viewport:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The viewport is the visible area of a web page displayed on a device. It's not necessarily the same as the entire web page; it's what the user sees on their screen.</li>
                    <li>Initially, when mobile browsing started, viewports were often smaller than the actual screen size, leading to websites not displaying optimally. To counter this, the `<meta>` tag with attributes like `viewport` was introduced in HTML to control the viewport's behavior.<br>
                <pre><code>
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
                </code></pre>                            
                    </li>

                    <li>The viewport meta tag allows developers to set parameters like width, initial scale, and more, enabling better control over how the web page is displayed on different devices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Media Queries:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Media queries are CSS techniques used to apply different styles to a website based on the characteristics of the device displaying it, such as screen width, height, orientation (landscape or portrait), resolution, and more.</li>
                    <li>By using media queries in CSS, developers can create responsive designs that adapt and change layout, font sizes, or other styling properties depending on the device's features.</li>
                    <li>Media queries are defined using the `@media` rule in CSS and allow you to specify different styles for different conditions. For instance, you might have one set of styles for screens wider than 1200px and another for screens narrower than 600px.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Relationship:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Viewport settings help define how a webpage should initially appear on a device, while media queries allow for adjustments to the layout and styling based on the device's characteristics after the initial rendering.</li>
                    <li>Viewport settings help ensure that the content scales properly to the device, and media queries build on this foundation by adjusting the layout, content organization, and styling to offer the best user experience across various devices and screen sizes.</li>
                </ul>
